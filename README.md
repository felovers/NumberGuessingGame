# Number Guessing Game
A little game I made while practicing WPF on which you try to guess the number that the program picked.

The game is essentialy a program that picks a random number between 1 and 5 and you try to guess which number it picked.

It is in Portuguese-BR right now but I'll work on an English translation soon.
